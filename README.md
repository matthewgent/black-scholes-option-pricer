# Black Scholes Option Pricer

## Description
A single page web application that allows a user to input the five different option properties and determine
the price, delta, gamma, vega, theta and rho values for both call and put options using the Black Scholes
pricing model. It also provides a heat map for both options showing the sensitivity of option price to both
spot price and volatility.

## Developer Instructions

## User Instructions

volatility of the asset (Ïƒ) and the risk-free interest rate (usually the 10Y bond yield).
